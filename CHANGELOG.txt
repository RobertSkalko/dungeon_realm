v.1.1.3

- try fix wipe command so it works from server command line (untested)
- removed the wipe command as its not needed now that its all automatic
- you shouldnt be able to enter old maps after a world reload/server reboot now
- might implement a system that checks so it only wipes the dimension if its getting too crowded
