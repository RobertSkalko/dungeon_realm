# Quick Intro/Guide

A Map Device
<ModAsset width="10%" location="dungeon_realm:map_device"/>

This is the first thing you need so Craft it!
The Map device is used to enter the Dungeon Realm, but there is 2 more components needed.

# Dungeon Maps
<ModAsset width="10%" location="dungeon_realm:dungeon_map"/>

These can be found inside any looted chest.

Right clicking the Map Device with them starts a new 'Map'.

Note: you also need to craft some Home Pearls to Enter.
They allow you to exit the Dungeon Realm without having to find the Teleportation Block.
Try not to lose these!

# What's a Map?
<ModAsset width="50%" location="dungeon_realm:map_room"/>

Every Dungeon Map counts as a limited 'ticket' to the Dungeon Realm.
You can only explore a single Dungeon within it with 1 map.
Note: with Addons, 1 dungeon can have many different extra challenges, but it's still 1 dungeon.

# What Can I do inside a map?
You can kill mobs, loot chests and solve puzzles to usually find more chests!

If you find this block, you can right click it to teleport to the Boss Arena.
<ModAsset width="10%" location="dungeon_realm:boss_teleport"/>

If you kill the boss inside, you can use this block to teleport to the reward room:
<ModAsset width="10%" location="dungeon_realm:reward_teleport"/>

This is Home teleport block, which teleports you to where you came from (right click it)
If you want to go straight to the overworld of wherever your base is, you can crouch+right-click it instead.
Otherwise it will teleport you to the last place inside the Dungeon Realm you were.
<ModAsset width="10%" location="dungeon_realm:teleport_back"/>

# What makes Maps special?
I'm glad you asked! The dimension is actually fairly unique and suited primarily for Adventure/RPG Modpacks:
- You are confined to a specific Dungeon, you can not exit it. You can only teleport back to your overworld(or home)
- Mobs do not respawn, they are spawned once per Map
- You can not break/place blocks, you are affectively in simulated adventure mode (you can whitelist some blocks like Grave mod blocks though)
- Mobs can't grief
- Mobs do not take environmental damage
Note: Most of these are configurable but you still probably want to keep the defaults
