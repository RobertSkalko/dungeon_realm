# What are Relics?
<ModAsset width="50%" location="dungeon_realm:relics"/>

Relics are items you find in the Dungeon Realm.
They can be socketed into the Map Device by using the Relic Key Item.

They provide various bonuses to any new Dungeon Map you start next time, thing like:
- More mob spawns
- Chance for more content
- Chance to duplicate Bosses
etc

Each relic type has a maximum limit. For example, you can only socket 9 general relics into a Map Device.

Addon mods like The Harvest and Ancient Obelisks come with new relic types!
